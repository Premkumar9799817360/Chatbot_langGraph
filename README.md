# 🤖 LangGraph & Agentic AI Learning Project

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a showcase of my **learning journey** in **LangGraph** and **Agentic AI**.  
LangGraph is an **amazing framework** that helps you **build powerful AI agents** with flexibility and control.  
Through this project, I explored how to create AI workflows, connect different components, and make them **think, remember, and respond like a real assistant**.  

I learned how **graph nodes**, **edges**, and **state** work together to form an AI workflow, and how to connect these with **LLM models** like **Google Gemini**.

## 🎯 What I Learned  

### 🗂 **Graph Structure**
- **Nodes** → Represent different steps in the AI’s thinking process.  
- **Edges** → Define the connection between these steps.  
- **State** → Keeps track of the current context and data while the AI is running.

### ⚙️ **AI Workflow**
- How to **run the framework**.  
- How each **node calls the LLM model**.  
- How to pass information between steps for smooth execution.  

### 🧠 **Persistence (Memory in AI)**
- How to store and retrieve **chat history** so the AI can remember past messages.  
- Why **memory** is important for making conversations natural.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| 🌐 **Google Generative AI** | Provides the powerful **Gemini model** for LLM responses. |
| 🔑 **Gemini API Key** | Secure key to access Google Gemini. |
| 🗺 **LangGraph** | Framework for building graph-based AI workflows. |
| 🔗 **LangChain** | Helps connect AI tools, memory, and logic. |
| 🎨 **Streamlit** | Simple and fast web UI for interacting with the AI. |

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Define the Nodes** → Each part of the AI logic is a separate node.  
2. **Connect with Edges** → Control how data flows between nodes.  
3. **Set the State** → Decide what data will be stored and used.  
4. **Integrate Gemini LLM** → Send inputs and get AI-powered answers.  
5. **Run on Streamlit** → Talk to the AI in a nice web interface.

## 💡 Why This Project is Special
- First hands-on experience with **Agentic AI**.  
- Learned how to **design AI workflows visually and logically**.  
- Implemented **memory persistence** for more realistic conversations.  
- Mixed **LangGraph + LangChain + Google Gemini** into a working AI app.

## 📚 My Takeaway
This project taught me **how AI can be built like a flowchart** but with real intelligence behind it.  
From **state handling** to **memory persistence**, I now understand how to make an AI agent not just answer but **remember and adapt**.  
💪 It’s a great step toward building **real-world AI assistants**.
